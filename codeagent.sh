# TWO BYTE-IDENTICAL COPIES OF THIS FILE EXIST. Edit only the first:
#
#   agent/codeagent.sh                     <- canonical; edit this one
#   datasqrl-plugin/scripts/codeagent.sh   <- copy shipped inside the plugin
#
# then run:  ./agent/sync-launcher.sh
#
# CI fails if they differ, so the copy cannot drift silently. A symlink would be
# the obvious way to avoid the duplication, and it does not work: Claude Code,
# Codex and Cursor all COPY a plugin into a local cache on install, and a
# relative symlink whose target lives outside the plugin directory is dropped by
# that copy — the installed plugin ends up with an empty scripts/ and every skill
# fails to find this launcher.
#
# Run DataSQRL Code Agent with local or cloud MCP server.
# Run this script from the workspace directory containing your DataSQRL project.
#
# Usage: ./codeagent.sh <requirements> [options...]
#
# The requirements string is the first positional argument. Any additional
# arguments are forwarded directly to the Python CLI (e.g., --mode,
# --disable-verification, --dry-run).
#
# Lifetime flags owned by THIS script (never forwarded to the Python CLI):
#
#   --detach   Start the run in a detached container and return in ~2s, printing the run
#              name. The run is owned by the Docker daemon, not by this shell, so it
#              survives the caller exiting, being interrupted, or timing out. Intended for
#              programmatic callers (Claude Code and other coding agents, CI). Interactive
#              users normally omit it and keep the streaming output.
#   --status   Print one status line: the in-flight run (last step, last activity), or the last
#              run's result. `--status N` prints the last N lines of the progress trail first.
#   --stop     Stop this project's in-flight run.
#   --wait     Block until this project's in-flight run ends, then print the --status line and
#              exit with the container's exit code. For programmatic callers: run it in the
#              background right after --detach and let your harness notify you when it exits.
#
# REQUIRES A GIT REPOSITORY. Run it from the SQRL project directory you want to build; the
# repository around that project defines what the agent can see:
#
#     -v <repo-root>:/workspace:ro                  whole repo, READ-ONLY (so the agent can
#                                                   discover sibling projects / shared catalogs)
#     -v <repo-root>/<project>:/workspace/<project> your project, READ-WRITE (the ONLY writable
#                                                   place — nothing else can be modified)
#
# Because the repo's directory structure is preserved verbatim, every relative path the agent
# writes (e.g. "script.include": {"data_catalog": {"package": "../data-catalog/package.json"}}) is equally valid in your real repo.
# Invoked at the repo root, the project IS the repo and a single read-write mount is used.
#
# Set CODEAGENT_ALLOW_NO_GIT=1 to bypass the git requirement (CI/automation only); the current
# directory is then treated as a standalone single project.
#
# Authentication (in order of precedence):
#   1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var
#   2. CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN env var (from `claude setup-token`)
#   3. ~/.claude/.credentials.json (from `claude login`)
#   4. macOS Keychain (extracted automatically from `claude login`)
#
# Required environment variables:
#   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

# The image every run uses. This is the same local name `build-docker-local.sh` produces and
# `test-docker-local.sh` validates, so a local build is picked up with no extra flag.
#
# No registry serves this name, so preflight bootstraps it from the published image (pull + tag)
# when it is missing — the two commands users previously had to run by hand.

# plan checklist). The name must therefore be DETERMINISTIC per project — no timestamp in it, or
# every run would get a fresh name and lock nothing.
#
# --rm is what keeps the lock from going stale: an exited container would otherwise keep holding
# its name forever, and every later run would be refused until someone ran `docker rm` by hand.
# With --rm the lock is released by the same event that ends the run, however it ends.
#
